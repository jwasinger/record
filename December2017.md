 - Attempted to transcompile ethereum tests to ewasm at runtime in ethereumjs-vm.  Spent time debugging a memory leak when invoking `evm2wasm` in nested asynchronous code.  Separate approach is to transcompile all the state tests to EWASM as part of a build process. See: https://github.com/jwasinger/ewasm-tests
