## 11/20
Hours: 8
 - Adapting Geth p2p implementation for use in https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-eth-bridge, with the immediate goal of isolating the necessary code to do a full blockchain sync from the devp2p network
 - Trying to isolate __ProtocolManager__ from __eth/handler.go__ and run it standalone (without the rest of Geth)
